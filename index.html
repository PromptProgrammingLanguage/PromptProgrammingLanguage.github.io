            <p>
                Prompt is a programming language based on relational ai prompts. 
            </p>
            <p>
                It's useful because it helps you chain multiple ai sessions together (REPL loops in programming lingo), and
                weave them into the programming tools you already know.
            </p>
            <p>
                Prompt is a tiny language, you can learn it in less than fifteen minutes.

            </p>

            <h4>Names</h4>
            <p>
                <code class="inline-example"><pre>
    <em>table</em>

        }
    }
                </pre></code>
                The names of prompts consist of alphanumeric characters or an underscore.
            </p>

            <h4>Options</h4>
            <p>
                <code class="inline-example"><pre>
    table<em>
        direction: >

            </p>
            <p>
                Options specified to a prompt are given as YAML. The following options are supported:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Description:</strong>
                    <p>
                        A description given to the AI agent at the start of the session. This should be used to set up
                        the users interactions with the AI generally. "Setting the scene" if you will.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Direction:</strong>
                    <p>
                        A direction given to the ai appended immediately after everything the user says. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For example, if you set the direction to "Answer every question with a question. No questions 
                        asked." When the user asks, "How tall are giraffes?" Then the AI may respond with "Have you
                        ever seen a giraffe up close before?" Instead of something more useful.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Eager: (defaults to false)</strong>

                    <p>
                        This will allow the AI to respond before accepting user input.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>History: (defaults to true)</strong>

                    <p>
                        Keeps a running log of the conversation. This log presists betweens prompt runs, but is
                        labotomized when reaching the maximum token length of your given provider.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Bodies</h4>
            <p>
                This is where the magic happens. Prompt has a few statements you can use to stitch it together with
                with other prompts and your CLI programs.
            </p>

            <ul>

                    <p>
                        If you just want to use the output of the AI agent in your programs you can use backticks to
                        specify that you're running a command. The command executes in your default shell. The $USER
                        and $AI environment variables are added.

                    <p>
                        You can use an arrow to redirect either of the raw user or ai input to another prompt defined
                        in the same file.

                    <p>
                        It's also possible to run a shell command and then redirect its output to another prompt. Notice
                        that we completely ignore the "double_checker" ai here because we don't trust it, we instead
                        send the output of the previous "silly" ai prompt to a "human_safety_protocols" script to verify
                        (with magic) that we're definitely not launching skynet.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Our final coding construct is the match statement. It's used to parse either ai or user input
                        with regular expressions. The seperate match statements are evaluated in order, with the first
                        successful match winning and the rest being ignored. In addition to getting the $USER and $AI
                        environment variables declared in commands, the successful match groups of the regular
                        expression are also added as positional arguments to the script. If the match groups are given
                        names, they are also added.

                    <p>
                        The documentation for the implementation can be found in Rust's
                        <a href="https://docs.rs/regex/1.7/regex/#syntax">Regex crate</a>. It loosely matches the
                        PCRE2 implemenation on the <a href="https://regex101.com/">Regex101</a> website, but not
                        entirely. You can use that as a jumping off point though, if you do not have a strong
                        understanding of regular expressions. ChatGPT will also help a great deal as well.

            <h3>The CLI Program</h3>

            <p>
                For now, executing prompt files is done from the
                 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface">Command Line</a>. After
                 <a href="#releases">getting prompt</a> you can run prompts with
                 <code>
                    <pre>
    OPEN_AI_API_KEY="INSERT_OPEN_AI_API_KEY_HERE" ./prompt ./path-to-promt-file.pr
                    </pre>
                 </code>
                 
            </p>
            <p>
                Here's the --help
                <code>
                    <pre>
    ./prompt --help

    Usage: prompt [OPTIONS] <PATH>

    Arguments:
      (PATH)  Path to the main prompt file

    Options:
      -w, --watch (WATCH)  What session file to watch, if any
      -q, --quiet          By default, we output the result of commands in a
                            final position to stdout (the terminal). This will
                            suppress that output
      -h, --help           Print help
      -V, --version        Print version
